# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. It utilizes the Titanic dataset, which contains various features about passengers, such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and their survival status. This classic beginner project provides insights into data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning modeling techniques.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this project can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Ensure that you have the dataset saved locally in the specified path.

## Features

The dataset contains the following key features:

- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (with missing values replaced by 'Unknown')
- **Survived**: Survival status (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive)

## Installation

Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
